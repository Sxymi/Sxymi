# Hi :wave:

**@Sxymi** here.  
  
I already did one major, and now I am starting another one. **Informatics**!  
IT industry is a place where I want to develop my career. But firstly I have to start somewhere :sweat_smile:.  
I still have a lot to learn, but let's be honest. In this industry everyone learn each day.  
So if there is a employer which decide to give me a chance, I am ready for that challenge and I will do my best to not ruin your company :wink::innocent:.
